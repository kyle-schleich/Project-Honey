Things that are needed.
Have a docker installer!!!!
EX is Cowrie
Possibly try this without docker first :shrug:
    1. Honeypot setup
        a. Install docker. (Dockerize all honeypots?)
        b. Are there any changes needed for every install (names...)
        c. Bring in our default config (pretty much just logs?)
        d. Now we need our specific config.
        e. What are we changing outside of just the .conf file for the config
        g. Just having cowrie be a volume seems like its bad practice
            Pretty sure its still worth it though?
            Wont work.
        f. Run custom made docker-compose/docker files
    2. Filebeat setup
        a. All logs should be stored in a shared volume so this could be in its 
            own docker, in the honeypot one, or on the host.
        b. Config should have some magic identifiers
    3. Extra stuff to send back to the central server
        a. This can also be in anything that filebeats can be in.

and ansible -_-?
