## Quantum Legacy
### A C2 server for Honeypots. 


What is the point of a honeypot, of logs at all if you can't easily view them? You can get all the awesome samples in the world but its not helping you if you canâ€™t access them.
Thats where Quantum Legacy comes in.
Quantum Legacy centralizes all of the data that honeypots capture. It takes the deployment, management, and updating of those honeypots.

This is still in very early testing.
